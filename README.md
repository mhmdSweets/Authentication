Security & Authentication Practice

This code explores security principles like user registration with bcrypt password hashing and login with session management (using Passport.js, if applicable).  Get it running with npm install and environment variables (.env file).  Refer to comments or additional docs for usage specifics. This practice code is for learning purposes and might require further security hardening for production. Feel free to contribute (guidelines provided) and explore improvements! (MIT License)
